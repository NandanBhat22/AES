# Advanced encryption standard (AES) in Verilog

# Explanation:
he Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a FIPS-approved symmetric cryptographic algorithm used to protect electronic data.
AES is a block cipher that encrypts plaintext into ciphertext and decrypts it back to its original form.
It operates on fixed-size data blocks of 128 bits.
AES supports cryptographic key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, offering strong and efficient security.
